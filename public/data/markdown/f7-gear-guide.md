### Notes:

I Highly recommend checking out other guides:
A. Full progression guide there by KPRL
B. My berserker thread on forums: [https://hypixel.net/threads/my-magnum-opus-5-2k-words-rogues-fully-detailed-guide-to-berserker-class-f1-m5-gear-progression-bosses-tech.5919788/](https://hypixel.net/threads/my-magnum-opus-5-2k-words-rogues-fully-detailed-guide-to-berserker-class-f1-m5-gear-progression-bosses-tech.5919788/)

* **DO NOT USE PRIMORDIAL HELMET:** It has way worse total base stats than necron helmet, plus it is 3 times more expensive and only one gem slot. It has also worse EHP than it. The 150 Crit Damage Bonus is FLAT!
* **TIGER PET FEROCITY IS DISABLED FOR BERS** SO FOR ONCE IN YOUR LIFE STOP USING IT AND GET LION ASAP
* **Lion > Wither Skeleton**, Get over it
* **Do not waste money on those weapons:** Livid Dagger, Shadow Fury, Giant's Sword, Aspect Of The Dragons, Valkyrie, Dark Claymore, Felthorn Reaper (Outclassed By Both Swords and Terminator)
